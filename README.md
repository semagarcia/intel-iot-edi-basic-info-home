# intel-iot-edi-basic-info-home
This repository will allocate the first project with my new Intel Edison IoT hardware.

# Introduction and purpose
The purpose of that code is to learn and work with the dev kit, its sensors and their capabilities when they are working together. That app is the first approach to the Intel Edison and all of this work is included in the instructable where all steps have been published.

What is the purporse of a "comfortable and safe environment? I live in a shared flat with other 2 mates, and each one has its own room, its private space, its own world. Thinking about the sensors I've found in the kit it could be a good idea to develop a system in order to monitorize my room, at least, three basic factors: temperature, light and gas. WTF?!?!? Gas??? Yeah... Although inside of a room that sensor could be a nonsense, this prototype could be exported to other part of the house or make it more scalable.
